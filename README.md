# Enhancing Twitter Data through Framester's Semantic Frames: Building and Enriching a Knowledge Graph

Analyzing social media texts is a pivotal area of research, with language's depth playing a crucial role. However, the intricate nature of language presents a significant challenge for contemporary natural language processing methods. Thus, the application of semantic frame analysis emerges as a vital tool for enhancing text analysis through linguistic understanding.

This master's thesis focuses on enriching the exploration of diverse perspectives and political narratives within social media texts. This enrichment is accomplished by employing semantic frame analysis, a method that delves into how linguistic structures trigger the activation of conceptual frames. Subsequently, the thesis investigates the integration of these activated frames into a comprehensive semantic analysis.

The analysis commences by extracting semantic frames from Twitter data, utilizing the Fluid Construction Grammar Editor. These extracted frames are then combined by harnessing a SPARQL query to access Framester, a knowledge graph amalgamating various linguistic resources like PropBank, FrameNet, WordNet, and VerbNet. The culmination of this process involves generating a knowledge graph that represents the derived insights.

Through this research, a deeper understanding of social media texts, their underlying frames, and the connections between linguistic components is achieved, thereby contributing to the advancement of social media text analysis.
